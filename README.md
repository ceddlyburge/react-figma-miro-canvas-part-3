This repository contains code accompanying a [blog post on how to write a figma / miro style canvas in react and typescript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-figma-miro-style-canvas-with-react-and-typescript/).

This is the final part, where cards can be dragged around a canvas, new cards can be dragged on to the canvas from a tray, and the canvas can be panned and zoomed.

You can run the code with npm run dev.

You can view a live demo of the code at https://ceddlyburge.github.io/react-figma-miro-canvas-part-3/
