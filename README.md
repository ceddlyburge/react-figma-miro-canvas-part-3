This repository contains code accompanying a blog post on how to write a figma / miro style canvas in react and typescript.

This is the final part, where cards can be dragged around a canvas, new cards can be dragged on to the canvas from a tray, and the canvas can be panned and zoomed.

You can run the code with npm run dev.
